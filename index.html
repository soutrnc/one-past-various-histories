            <h2>Controversy</h2>
            <p>
              It is defined as disagreement between two or more parties, with
              each party having their own point of view for the said topic or
              event. Examples are the controversy on where the first mass in the
              Philippines was held. The two parties here have their own point of
              views. The first believes that it was in Butuan, Agusam del Norte;
              and the second party believes that it was held in Limasawa,
              Southern Leyte.

            <h2>Inconsistency</h2>
            <p>
              It is a state wherein two or more information are contradicting.
              Examples are the dates that were given during the controversy in
              the first mass. It is believed that the first mass was held on the
              31st of March, 1521 but a monument near the Agusan River states
              that the first mass was held on the 8th of April 1521. The
              inconsistencies between information can lead to more problems that
              need fixing.

            <h2>Argument</h2>
            <p>
              Arguments are the opinions or the statements that each side is
              presenting to support their claims. Let us go back to the
              controversy in the first mass in the Philiippines again. People
              believed that the first mass was held in Butuan beacuse of a
              monument, a brick pillar that has an inscription that states that
              the first mass happened here on the 8th of April 1521.
