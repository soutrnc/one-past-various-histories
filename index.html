              Philippines was held. The two parties here have their own point of
              views. The first believes that it was in Butuan, Agusam del Norte;
              and the second party believes that it was held in Limasawa,

              Examples are the dates that were given during the controversy in
              the first mass. It is believed that the first mass was held on the
              31st of March, 1521 but a monument near the Agusan River states
              that the first mass was held on the 8th of April 1521. The
              inconsistencies between information can lead to more problems that

              controversy in the first mass in the Philiippines again. People
              believed that the first mass was held in Butuan beacuse of a
              monument, a brick pillar that has an inscription that states that
              the first mass happened here on the 8th of April 1521.

            Though our beliefs were bent for over three (3) centuries due to
            inconsistencies of information, luckily it was all resolved due to
            the help of many historians and people that were willing to correct
            the misinformation that was spread widely by writers who wrote about
            the Butuan Tradition during the 17th to 10th century.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first mass in the Philippines occurred on the 31st of March in
            the year 1521 in Limasawa, Leyte. What caused the controversy was
            when Pigaffeta said in his account that the first mass happened on
            an island called “Mazaua”, the problem here is that Pigafetta had
            not clearly stated which place, is it from the island of Mindanao or
            from the islands of Southern Visayas.
          </p>
          <p>
            This had led to two points of views, the first one believed that the
            first had happened in Butuan, due to the fact that there was a
            monument (a stone brick pillar) located near the mouth of the Agusan
            River. In the monument, there was an inscription, the inscription
            was honoring Magellan and his subordinates for coming in this land
            for the first mass on the 8th of April, 2021. This has been the
            Butuan tradition for over three (3) centuries starting from the 17th
            century all the way up to the 19th century. On the monument, we can
            already see a misinformation where it said that the first mass
            occurred on the 8th of April 1521 where in fact the first mass
            occurred on the 31st of March 1521 on Easter Sunday. This was an
            error on their side as they were trying to translate the date using
            the Gregorian Calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Limasawa, Leyte was believed to be the place that the first mass was
            held in the Philippines by the second point of view. Though it was
            really on island of Limasawa where the first mass was held, this
            opinion or fact wasn’t really accepted until the 19th century came
            when two primary sources where rediscovered and the opinion had
            started to shift. Those primary sources were Pigafetta’s account and
            Albo’s logs, a quick refresher on who Pigafetta and Albo is. Both of
            them were with Magellan in his mission to be the first person to
            circle around the globe in his expedition. Both of them also wrote a
            journal or a memoir of their expedition, from them finding out the
            islands, exchanging gifts with the people, and to the events that
            led up to first mass.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, the Butuan tradition has been widely accepted and trusted
            by people for three (3) centuries that said that the first mass was
            held on Butuan due to the fact that there was a monument (brick
            pillar) located near the mouth of the Agusan River but this has
            started to change since the rediscovery of two new primary sources,
            those were Pigafetta’s account and Albo’s logs. On the 15th of July
            in the year 2020, it was officially declared by the NHCP (National
            Historic Commision of the Philippines) that the site of the first
            mass was held in Limasawa after a long process of restudying the
            evidences that started in the year 2008.

          <h4 class="content-body-title">Short Summary</h4>
          <p>
            The Cavite Mutiny was one of the most important events that happened
            in the Philippine History, it was a failed uprising of the Filipinos
            in an attempt to overthrow the Spanish regime on the 20th of January
            in the year 1872. This event had marked the re-awakenning of the
            patriotism of the Filipino people and this was also one of the major
            inspirations of our national hero Dr. Jose Rizal to write the novels
            Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo which had shown just how cruel
            and merciless that Spanish regime would be during their reign.
          </p>
          <p>
            This event had different sides of the story, the first being the
            Spanish version which was narrated by Jose Monetero y Vidal who
            wrote a book called Historia General de Filipinas, and the other one
            was by Dr. Trininadad Tavera.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Filipino version had stated that the mutiny happened due to the
            fact that the current Governor and Captain-General that time, Rafael
            Geronimo Cayetano Izquierdo’s policies among the laborers and native
            Filipinos and Filipino soldiers were harsh and there was inequality
            among those who payed the taxes, according to some sources the taxes
            that time were increasingly getting higher and higher. Furthermore,
            it was due to the loss of privileges and freedom that the revolt
            happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the Spanish version had told quite a different
            story, in their version they were trying to blame the Filipinos for
            what had happened on the 21st of January in the year 1872. They
            stated that it was due to the Filipinos, especially native soldiers
            and laborers revolting against the Spanish regime that the mass
            killing were carried out. This was also supported by the Izquierdo
            himself who wrote a personal letter that was addressed to the
            government after the monarchy was overthrown in Spain’s own civil
            war.

          <p>
            After the failed uprising in an attempt to overthrow the Spanish
            regimen in 1872, or most commonly known as the Cavite Mutiny,
            another organization was secretly in the works under the command of
            Andres Bonifacio. This organization would lead and the revolution of
            the Filipino people against the Spanish regime, the name of the
            organization was KKK or Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng
            mga Anak ng Bayan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet another controversy that still, to this day has not been
            resolved yet due to the many inconsistencies that each of the
            accounts and other sources presented had shown. To this day, we
            don’t know when the exact date of the beginning of the Revolution
            against the Spanish had started, some sources had stated that it was
            in the 23rd of August, some said that it was in the 24th and some
            even said that it was in the 25th and 26th. In the YouTube video I
            watched regarding the Katinpunan’s Cry, Andres Bonifacio, portrayed
            by Robin Padilla was making a speech and stated that On this day,
            the 29th of August they needed to oust the Spanish regime in order
            to stop the bloodshed of their own kind and their people, he also
            stated that this is our land and our land alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            With so many versions of the event, five (5) to be exact people had
            just stated that the Katipunan’s Cry happened of the August of 1896.
            Among the five (5) version of the event, it was Guillermo
            Masangkay’s account or version that was deemed as the most reliable
            source. Guillermo Masangkay was the General of the Katipunan that
            time, he was with Andres Bonifacio and the rest of the organization.
            He referred to the Katipunan’s Cry as the Cry of Balintawak and had
            stated that it happened on the 26th of August 1896. The reason why
            this was the most accepted version was due to the fact that
            Guillermo Masangkay was present during that history day where each
            member of the Katipunan had brought out their Cedulas Personales and
            ripped them apart before shouting some patriotic cry’s such as
            Mabuhay ang Katipunan, Mabuhay ang Pilipinas. happened.

            Controversies form where there is inconsistency and arguments form
            when parties try to defend their side. The gist here is that, if
            people are consistent with everything controversies and arguments
            won't be form, but in reality inconsistencies cannot be avoided. The
            best solution here is to do your research properly.
